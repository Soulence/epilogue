# MetaCTF

Grab a friend, and compete in this year's CTF to win cool prizes!

The crew from [MetaCTF](https://metactf.com) has been hard at work preparing a variety of challenges. As opposed to the stump-the-chump style events, this is a learning CTF. While there will be plenty of hard challenges, the goal is for you to walk away with some new tools, techniques, and skills. Challenges will span a number of categories including reconnaissance, web exploitation, forensics, and maybe even some hardware hacking.

The CTF will run all day, and teams of 1-2 people can compete. You will probably want an updated Kali machine, but we will provide everything else.

Check back later for an exact schedule and location!
