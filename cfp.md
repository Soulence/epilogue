# Call for Papers

You can submit your CFP here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeBTm2AqCvxHFVhQzQNvjM47t19tDlOp0Szqhk4Yr00o5iNHQ/viewform

Timeline:

- ** Jan 3 - CFP closes**
- ** Jan 10 - CFP winners announced **

We realize this is a tough timeline to hit for people who travel. But if you submit and don't get accepted, as long as it's a "decent" (yes subjective, read "no-automated") submission, you'll get a link to pay for a ticket into the con, even if we are sold out.
