| **Forgotten History of Cyber Warfare** 	| SecureSean 	| 10:00 	| 10:20 	|
| **Zero-Knowledge doesn’t mean Zero Ethics** <br/> --A Quick overview of Zero Knowledge systems and the effects this has on Ethical concerns about content, users, and content creators	| Quadling 	| 10:30 	| 10:50 	|
| **Preventing a Hostile Matrix: A VR, AR, and Game Security Call to Arms** <br/> --Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are the next frontier, and as a new medium brings presentation closer to wetware which can have serious consequences if not done properly. This talk will go over a few problems found in game design mentality along with a few problems found in game assets for Unity3D, a common engine for VR and AR. It will also cover some ways this could affect people if done wrong and some ideas on how to fix it. This is a call to arms. This is our chance to start relatively fresh with a new communications medium, let’s seize the opportunity while we can to do this right.	| Peter Clemenko 	| 11:00 	| 11:55 	|
| **LUNCH HOUR XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX** 	| XXXXXXXXXXXX 	| 12:00 	| 12:55 	|
| **LUNCH TALK Slash AppSec Costs, Free Threat Modeling & Compliance Data Output** <br/> --A work in progress tool will be demonstrated, along with current status. The tool enables security architects, engineers, and developers to model their application/system security requirements, with the tool expanding the list of requirements to a more actionable list for design, risk-benefit trade-off analysis, testing and compliance purposes. Security functional requirements libraries and threat modeling mitigation libraries will be community maintained.	| John Willis 	| 12:30 	| 12:55 	|
| **Et tu, Youtube?** <br/> --As security professionals and network defenders we are beset with the difficult task of protecting the environments and applications that our user populations inhabits and use from a multitude of potential security pitfalls.  However there are potential non-vulnerability related elements in online applications that can negatively affect a home, organization or business other than the latest greatest application vulnerabilities.  These issues can even be found in common online application such as "Youtube".  Issues that can leave a person or institution vulnerable to a lawsuit for possession of intellectual property, offensive material, or at the very least, violation of an acceptable use policy.  This talk will attempt to make these issues known and cover positive and negative aspects of access to this common application that some security practitioner's do not recognize as vulnerable in addition to attempting to provide potential remediation to these issues.	| Infojanitor 	| 13:00 	| 13:55 	|
| **Fast File Forensics with PowerShell** <br/> --Many investigations revolve around routine questions... did this employee have a specific file?  What sites have they been visiting? This talk will delve into PowerShell scripts that can be used to quickly and reliably gather this sort of information... at scale! | Mick Douglas 	| 14:00 	| 14:55 	|
| **Genetic Malware: Designing Payloads for Specific Targets** <br/> -- Dropping a payload or malware onto a target is usually not an issue given the variety of vulnerable software in use. Your challenge is keeping the payload from working and spreading to unintended targets, eventually leading to malware reverse engineers that pick apart your work, and start an industry to stop your livelihood. This presentation will discuss techniques that keep your malware payloads focused on particular targets; from methods that will not work outside the target environment, to techniques that would drive a malware reverse engineer mad. We will include POCs written in multiple languages and a framework for implementing these techniques that will help keep your hard work from making headlines by hobbyists with too much free time on their hands. | Josh Pitts 	| 15:00 	| 15:55 	|
| **Salt The Battlefield** <br/> --I will demonstrate how SaltStack can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes due to its ability to scale, resist takeover, resist takedown, attack, and reconfigure, and defend a network in real time.  	| SecureSean 	| 16:00 	| 16:20 	|
| **Essential Tools for the Cyber Cop** <br/> --An introduction of the 8 capability areas necessary to Cyber criminal investigations.  The presentation uses examples from FBI and other law enforcement investigations to show how these tools are used (and chained together) to identify, locate, apprehend, and convict suspects.	| Obitori 	| 16:30 	| 16:50 	|
| **How to Train to be Trained in InfoSec** <br/> --There are several excellent presentations on how to get into infosec, but many of them assume you are in IT already.  What if you barely can spell IT?  What do you need to know to learn what you need to know?  This presentation will cover how to help one go from zero to, well, grasshopper.	| reswob10 	| 17:00 	| 17:20 	|

This talk will show you some scripts, scoring tools, and techniques to take your security program to the next level. 	| Mick Douglas 	| 18:30 	| 18:55 	|
| **Double Feature: How I stopped worrying and learned to love the APT/A review of the BSidesDC Kids Crypto Challenges and Lessons Learned and tips for starting your own challenge** <br/> --Science Fiction, Double Feature, Doctor X won't be building a creature, instead he will be ranting about why we're so obsessed with APT and 0day when we can't even get the basics of INFOSEC and ITSEC (yes there's a difference) hygiene right.  Can we get a handle on some of the basics like asset management and end user awareness before we start worrying about APTs? <br/>Second feature will be a review of the 2015 and 2016 BSidesDC Kids Crypto Challenges, the lessons learned from them, tips for building your own challenge and some of what is going into the planning for 2017. 	| Andrew Shumate 	| 19:00 	| 19:55 	|
| **DevOOPS: Attacks And Defenses For DevOps Toolchains** --DevOps tool-chains are transforming Modern IT, but hackers can undermine their benefits through poorly implemented or vulnerable DevOps tools. Chris Gates and Ken Johnson will share their collaborative attack research into the technology driving DevOps. They will share an attacker’s perspective on exploiting DevOps organizations and the countermeasures these organizations should employ.	| Chris Gates and Ken Johnson 	| 20:00 	| 20:55 	|
