# Call for Papers

You can submit your CFP here: http://bit.ly/epiloguecfp2017

Timeline:

- ** Jan 1 - CFP closes**
- ** Jan 10 - CFP winners announced **

We realize this is a tough timeline to hit for people who travel. But if you submit and don't get accepted, as long as it's a "decent" (yes subjective, read "no-automated") submission, you'll get a link to pay for a ticket into the con, even if we are sold out.

So now let's talk about talks!

What do we want to see and hear about at Shmoocon Epilogue?

Well, have you ever been to a NOVAHackers meeting?
No!?!?!?!?
Why not?

Ok, so the talks are very technical, Attack/Defend/Technique/Tool talks. 

However, if you have a social science talk, a industry talk, etc, you're still welcome to submit!
We like technical talks, but meta talks about the industry are still interesting, and give us great perspective.
