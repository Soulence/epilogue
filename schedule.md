| **Inflow** | NOVA | 0900 | 1000 |
| **Let's Blow Up the SIEM and Start Over** <br/> --Security and Operations teams too much time buying and managing security products and not enough time doing work in the furtherance of their missions. What would an alternative world look like? Much of what the security products do can be accomplished using lightweight, free and open source tools. Compliance monitoring, behavioral and specification based intrusion detection, database monitoring, data loss detection, machine learning, security analytics and threat hunting can be accomplished through the coordinated usage of open source tools. Demo included. | Craig Chamberlain | 1000 | 1100 |
| **Aggressive Autonomous Actions - Operating with Automation** <br/> --This talk is designed to show how automation can help on a red team assessment in multiple methods. For example, it can help automate the boring tasks you don't want to do, it can help protect the assessment's OPSEC by preventing operators from running commands likely to be detected, it can also help with the reporting phase of every assessment. There's a way to automate tasks at every point of an assessment, and the presentation includes the code that will ideally allow attendees to leverage automation. I have an outline if you would like to see that too, just shoot me an e-mail and I can provide it. | Christopher Truncer | 1100 | 1200 |
| **Lunch** | NOVA | 1200 | 1230 |
| **Testing With Proxmox** <br/> --Proxmox is a free virtualization platform similar to VMWare ESX that is based on opensource debian, LXC and KVM with a killer UI. Proxmox is well engineered, with built-in firewall, high availability, and also plenty of command-line options. The talk is geared towards pentesters who want to setup their own pentest environment on low end hardware, securely. | Fred M | 1230 | 1300 |
| **The Jinja Ninja: Exploiting Jinja Template Engine for Code Execution** <br/> --Jinja2 is one of the most used template engines for Python. An exploitation of JInja through of the lesser known web vulnerabilities, Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) can be used to achieve remote code execution in a python web application. This talk would demonstrate how to detect the vulnerability, exploit it using multiple options from Python builtin objects to plugins and extensions and then run remote code execution for fun or for profit. | Eyitemi Egbejule | 1300 | 1330|
| **SNACK** | NOVA | 1330 | 1400 |
| **How to People: When the Tech Works But Communication is Broken** <br/> --Everyday, new cyber attacks are crafted and new defenses are deployed. Infosec professionals are continuously learning new tools and techniques in order to keep up with the constantly evolving threat landscape and to work together to secure our future. Often times though, people focus on improving their technical skills but forget about the other key aspects of cybersecurity: teamwork and communication. | Mariah | 1400 | 1430 |
| **PowerShell SSL/TLS Intercept Tool** <br/> --An entry level and accessible approach to SSL/TLS interception on a local host using PowerrShell | netsmith | 1430 | 1500 |
| **Be Smart about Bringing Home IoT** <br/> --Have you been interested in building a smart home but don't know where to start? In this talk we will talk about how as part of a home renovation project, we transformed a house to be a smart home. While considering the needs and wants of others living in the home, Joshua will present how he added voice controls, robot skills, wall based controllers, cameras, smart locks, thermostats, in-wall dimmer light switches and fan controllers, speakers, and wiring with battery backup to create a smart home without breaking the bank or compromising the security of his home. <br>
The hope is that at the end of this talk, you will be able to pick the features that are right for you and be able to join the smart home revolution too. Also critiques and criticism from those who have started on this journey as well are welcome to help direct this project and provide insight for others who choose to come and learn. | Josh | 1500 | 1600 |
| **How to Solve Cybersecurity: New Paradigms for a New Era** <br/> | Sounil | 1600 | 1700 |
| **Dinner** | NOVA | 1800 | 1830 |
| **Empire Mice: Empire stagers via mousejacking** <br/> --MouseJacking is not a new technique, but it is still widely exploitable and a very useful technique to get your initial foothold in a network. In this presentation I plan to briefly talk about what mousejacking is and show how we can use it to inject a Empire stager to gain a foothold in our target network and begin pivoting. | Skylar Simmons | 1830 | 1900 |
| **Watch All the Things** <br/> --The Endpoint Monitoring Team at Capital One deploys and manages one of the largest open source/freeware security solutions in the world. Combining the power of OSQuery, Sysmon, Windows Eventlogs, and NXLog, we are able to monitor tens of thousands of endpoints on-premise and in the cloud. The team develops and maintains simple pipelines to minimize the amount of overhead and cost while at the same time ensuring zero data lost from the endpoint to the SIEM. Our talk will discuss the critical infrastructure decisions we made, streaming vs batch data processing, as well as any custom integrations we developed to make the pipeline more robust. | Timothy Desrochers | 1900 | 2000 |

| **Preventing a Hostile Matrix: A VR, AR, and Game Security Call to Arms** <br/> --Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are the next frontier, and as a new medium brings presentation closer to wetware which can have serious consequences if not done properly. This talk will go over a few problems found in game design mentality along with a few problems found in game assets for Unity3D, a common engine for VR and AR. It will also cover some ways this could affect people if done wrong and some ideas on how to fix it. This is a call to arms. This is our chance to start relatively fresh with a new communications medium, let’s seize the opportunity while we can to do this right.	| Peter Clemenko 	| 11:00 	| 11:55 	|
| **LUNCH HOUR XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX** 	| XXXXXXXXXXXX 	| 12:00 	| 12:55 	|
| **LUNCH TALK Slash AppSec Costs, Free Threat Modeling & Compliance Data Output** <br/> --A work in progress tool will be demonstrated, along with current status. The tool enables security architects, engineers, and developers to model their application/system security requirements, with the tool expanding the list of requirements to a more actionable list for design, risk-benefit trade-off analysis, testing and compliance purposes. Security functional requirements libraries and threat modeling mitigation libraries will be community maintained.	| John Willis 	| 12:30 	| 12:55 	|
| **Et tu, Youtube?** <br/> --As security professionals and network defenders we are beset with the difficult task of protecting the environments and applications that our user populations inhabits and use from a multitude of potential security pitfalls.  However there are potential non-vulnerability related elements in online applications that can negatively affect a home, organization or business other than the latest greatest application vulnerabilities.  These issues can even be found in common online application such as "Youtube".  Issues that can leave a person or institution vulnerable to a lawsuit for possession of intellectual property, offensive material, or at the very least, violation of an acceptable use policy.  This talk will attempt to make these issues known and cover positive and negative aspects of access to this common application that some security practitioner's do not recognize as vulnerable in addition to attempting to provide potential remediation to these issues.	| Infojanitor 	| 13:00 	| 13:55 	|

| **Genetic Malware: Designing Payloads for Specific Targets** <br/> -- Dropping a payload or malware onto a target is usually not an issue given the variety of vulnerable software in use. Your challenge is keeping the payload from working and spreading to unintended targets, eventually leading to malware reverse engineers that pick apart your work, and start an industry to stop your livelihood. This presentation will discuss techniques that keep your malware payloads focused on particular targets; from methods that will not work outside the target environment, to techniques that would drive a malware reverse engineer mad. We will include POCs written in multiple languages and a framework for implementing these techniques that will help keep your hard work from making headlines by hobbyists with too much free time on their hands. | Josh Pitts 	| 15:00 	| 15:55 	|
