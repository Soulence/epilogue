# Call for Papers

You can submit your CFP below (or click this link): http://bit.ly/epiloguecfp2019


What do we want to see and hear about at Shmoocon Epilogue?  The Epilogue CFP is open!  We are looking for all talks regarding security from super technical to beginner.  Red/Blue/Purple/Physical security subjects are all accepted.  If you have a social science talk, a industry talk, etc, you're also welcome to submit. Meta talks about the industry give us great perspective.

Timeline:

    Jan 1 - CFP closes
    Jan 5 - CFP winners announced
   
We realize this is a tough timeline to hit for people who travel.  If you submit and don't get accepted, as long as it's a "decent" (yes subjective, read "not automatic") submission, you'll get a ticket into the con, even if we are sold out.
